                <b>The CentralDispatch System.</b> Through the CentralDispatch
                Site, we offer an Internet-based system (the "CentralDispatch
                System") that allows individuals and companies that have
                vehicles to ship to connect with vehicle transportation
                companies by: (1) allowing CD Members to post data and
                information regarding vehicles for shipment or vehicle
                transportation services, references, evidence of insurance
                coverage, copies of government licenses, and other data and
                information that can be reviewed by other CD Members who may be
                interested in entering into a business relationship, and (2)
                allowing CD Members to make their own independent evaluations of
                whether they are interested in entering into business
                relationships with other CD Members. The CentralDispatch System
                may also allow CD Members to "rate" other Members or to provide
                information of general interest to other CD Members with regard
                to, for example, truck stops, repair centers, and insurance
                companies. You understand and acknowledge that we do not and
                cannot control the reliability, completeness, usefulness,
                safety, or accuracy of information available through the
                CentralDispatch Site, including, without limitation, through the
                CentralDispatch System, because such data and information is
                provided solely by the CD Members over whom we have no control.

                <b>The jTracker System.</b> As an add-on to the CentralDispatch
                System, we offer an Internet-based system (the "jTracker
                System") that offers additional features to companies and
                individuals in the auto transport industry. The jTracker System
                allows users to, among other things, manage leads, quotes,
                orders, payments, and dispatching. In order to become and remain
                a JT Member, you must also be a CD Member and must maintain your
                subscription to the CentralDispatch System in good standing.

              has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner
              complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent
              or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the

                  <b>Arbitration.</b> You agree to arbitrate any dispute or
                  claim that you may have with us, or any of our affiliates,
                  that arises out of or relates in any way to the Sites, the
                  CentralDispatch System, or the JTracker System. Such
                  arbitration will be final and binding. If we elect in our
                  discretion to submit to arbitration any dispute or claim that
                  we may have against you, any such arbitration will be governed
                  by the provisions of this Section.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Class Waiver.</b> Any arbitration proceeding under this
                  Section will take place on an individual basis. Class
                  arbitrations and class or representative proceedings of any
                  kind are not permitted and you expressly waive your ability to
                  participate in a class or representative proceeding against us
                  or any of our affiliates. If the arbitration clause is found
                  inapplicable to your dispute with us, this class waiver will
                  continue to apply in litigation. You agree that this class
                  waiver is an essential element of the agreement between you
                  and us and that this class waiver may not be severed. In the
                  event that this class waiver is deemed invalid or
                  unenforceable, then the entire agreement to arbitrate in this
                  Section will be null and void.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Arbitrator Authority.</b> Any dispute or claim subject to
                  arbitration pursuant to this Section 23 must be submitted to
                  binding arbitration before a single arbitrator administered by
                  JAMS pursuant to JAMS Streamlined Rules. The arbitrator will
                  be bound by and will strictly enforce these Terms of Use and
                  any additional terms, agreements or attachments between you
                  and us and may not limit, expand or otherwise modify any of
                  the provisions of the foregoing. Any arbitration will be held
                  in Atlanta, Georgia, unless otherwise agreed upon by the
                  parties in writing. Each party will bear its own expenses in
                  the arbitration and will share equally the costs of the
                  arbitration; provided, however, that the arbitrator will award
                  the applicable party any costs and fees to which it may be
                  entitled under Section 18 in connection with any
                  indemnification claim. You agree that your transactions with
                  us evidence transactions in interstate commerce and that the
                  Federal Arbitration Act therefore governs the interpretation
                  and enforcement of this Section (notwithstanding the
                  application of Georgia law to any underlying claims). You also
                  agree that this Section shall survive the expiration or
                  termination of these Terms of Use.

              action, suit or proceeding that is not otherwise subject to
              mandatory arbitration pursuant to Section 23 and arises under or
              relates to the Sites, the CentralDispatch System, or the JTracker
              System, will be filed exclusively in a state or federal court
              located in Fulton County, Georgia; you consent to such forum and

              all oral and written agreements between the parties relating to

              with respect to the class action waiver in Section 23, if any
              provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court of competent
              jurisdiction to be contrary to law, invalid or unenforceable, such
              provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish
              the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent
              allowed by law and, in any event, the remaining provisions of
              these Terms of use will remain in full force and effect. No
              failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power,
              or remedy under these Terms of Use will operate as a waiver of any
              such right, power or remedy.
