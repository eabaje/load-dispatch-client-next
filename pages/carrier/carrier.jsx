              <h2>How It Works For Carriers</h2>
              <p>
                You post the vehicles you want to ship, where they are going,
                and what you are willing to pay to have each of them shipped.
                Carriers, who are already traveling your route and want to fill
                their trucks, contact you directly to transport your vehicle.
              </p>

              <p>
                {" "}
                While LoadDispatchÂ® is not a shipping company, we connect you to
                over 13,000 carriers ready to transport your vehicle. In
                addition, we provide access to U.S. DOT license information,
                insurance information and ratings for carriers as well as an
                online dispatching system to make dispatching faster and easier.
